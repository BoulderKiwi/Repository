When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Commits on the remote repository that are public allow other users to pull my code to ther local repository, sharing the code becomes easier. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Person B may push the changes, but unitl I commit and push my changes, I may not want the files pulled to my local directory.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Most recent commits on GitHub can be downloaded as a new branch to be viewed offline, then merged with my 
		local branch, when I don't have access to WiFi.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Saving mutlitple files and flash drives, or e-mailing files, or dropbox of finished work.
	This is harder because no logical history of changes (commits) or ability to merge.  I beleive 
	GitHub makes the coding more deliberate and provides a nice framework.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	Changes to a seperate branch when collaborating with others so that the Master is not changes (through pull requests only) without other person aware and approving 
	Changes to just master is faster, but better when only I am working on it solo.
