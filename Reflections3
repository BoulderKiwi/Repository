When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Commits on the remote repository that are public allow other users to pull my code to ther local repository, sharing the code becomes easier. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Person B may push the changes, but unitl I commit and push my changes, I may not want the files pulled to my local directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks (clones of a repository on Github and only gihub; point back to parent)
	Clones (clone a repository from Github to local)
	Branches (labels used to identify code that is not on Master(ie ready to show others) branch)
